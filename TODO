TODO list for ptimrout:
- terminate processes in the timeout group on normal exit
  When exiting on timout or on a terminating signal all
  processes are terminated.
  Though, when exiting normally (after completion of the monitored
  command) the termination of all processes in the group is
  not executed.
  Hence detached processes launched are not terminated when
  ptimeout terminates normally.
  It seems logical to apply the same termination process on
  normal exit as the user basically uses ptimeout to confine
  the execution of all processes into the lifetime of
  ptimeout itself.
- make compatible with python 2.4+ (remove 2.6.x requirement)
- add coverage regression checks in unit tests
- complete coverage with tests
- add pylint or pep8 checks in make check
