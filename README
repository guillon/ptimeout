The ptimeout utility is a python script implementing an interface similar to
GNU timeout with the additional ability to terminate all processes launched
from the timeout session.

This script requires python 2.6.x.

The script can be used directly without installation.

A makefile is provided anyway for completion and testing purpose.

Build with:
  $ make all # a no-op actually

Run unittests with:
  $ make check

Install with, for instance:
  $ make install PREFIX=$HOME/local  # Default is PREFIX=/usr/local
